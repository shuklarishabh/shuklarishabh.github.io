Hi! My name is Raunak and I am an undergraduate student studying computer
science at the University of British Columbia. I am passionate about
**algorithms** and **machine learning**. More specifically, I'm interested in
* better deep learning architectures and optimizers,
* applications of deep and reinforcement learning in healthcare, natural
  language tasks, computer vision and finance,
* randomized algorithms, especially in the realm of big data
* theoretical aspects of machine learning and algorithms in general.

I also take keen interest competitive programming, math, computer systems and
networking, and teaching. In my limited free time, I love travelling, swimming
and playing the guitar. I love the outdoors and British Columbia is a beautiful
province to go hiking.
