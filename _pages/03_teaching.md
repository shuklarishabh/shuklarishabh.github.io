I have found teaching to be a great way to learn!

## UBC

As an undergrad at UBC, I have been involved with the following courses.

### Instructor / Coordinator

* [CPSC 490](http://www.ugrad.cs.ubc.ca/~cs490/2016W2/) - Problem Solving in
  Computer Science: I co-taught this student seminar on practical applications
of advanced algorithms and data structures. My responsibilities included
lecturing a class of 15-30 students 3 times a week, writing lecture notes and
writing assignments.

### Teaching Assistant

As a TA, my responsibilities included lecturing sections ranging from 15 to 100
students, holding office hours, review sessions and grading. I have taught an
lecture for CPSC 420 and CPSC 320 as well. I won a [UBC Computer Science
Teaching Assistant
award](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/award/2017/05/ubc-computer-science-department-undergraduate-ta-award)
in 2017.

* [CPSC 420 / 500](https://www.ugrad.cs.ubc.ca/~cs420/2016W2/) - Advanced
  Algorithm Design and Analysis \*
* [CPSC 340](https://github.ubc.ca/cpsc340-2017S/home) - Machine Learning and
  Data Mining \*
* [CPSC 320](http://blogs.ubc.ca/cpsc3202016w1/) - Intermediate Algorithm Design
  and Analysis (2x)
* CPSC 213 - Introduction to Computer Systems (3x)
* [CPSC 121](https://www.ugrad.cs.ubc.ca/~cs121/2014W1/) - Models of
  Computation

\* indicates that usually only graduate students are assigned to TA these
courses but I was an undergrad when I did it.
